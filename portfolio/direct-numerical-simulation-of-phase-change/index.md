title: "Direct numerical simulation of phase change"
---

<p>This page summarises my master and PhD research on phase-change physics, with an emphasis on direct numerical simulation (DNS) and model development. This work was done at the <a href="https://www.psi.ch/en/lsm">Laboratory of Scientific Computing & Modelling of the Paul Scherrer Institute, Switzerland</a>.</p>

<h2>Focus</h2>
<p>Investigated fundamental mechanisms in phase-change phenomena, especially nucleate boiling, by developing and applying state-of-the-art DNS software.</p>

<h2>What I did</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Designed and implemented novel high-fidelity simulation workflows for phase-change problems.</li>
  <li>Verified and validated developed computational models.</li>
  <li>Analyzed the resulting data to understand key drivers.</li>
  <li>Translated findings into novel physics insights.</li>
  <li>Collaborated with international partners at several institutions, such as the Massachussetts Institute of Technology and the Kyushu Institute of Technology.</li>
  <li>Published scientific papers, presented at conferences and workshops, supervised students.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Outcomes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Contributed significantly to the <a href="https://github.com/Niceno/PSI-Boil/">PSI-BOIL</a> DNS software, adding and/or rewriting more than 100'000 lines of its C++ codebase.</li>
  <li>Obtained foundational results for my master and PhD theses. Awarded the <a href="https://enen.eu/index.php/phd-events/phd-ep-year-2022/">ENEN 2022 PhD prize</a> for my work.</li>
  <li>Published six peer-reviewed first-author journal papers as well as four peer-reviewed first-author conference papers. Several of the papers have been highly cited with my work contributing both to the state-of-the-art DNS algorithm development and to the understanding of physics of nucleate boiling.</li>
</ul>
