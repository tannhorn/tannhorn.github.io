title: "Direct numerical simulation of phase change"
---

<p><em>Draft:</em> This page summarizes my master's and PhD research on phase-change physics, with an emphasis on direct numerical simulation and high-fidelity modeling.</p>

<h2>Focus</h2>
<p>Investigated fundamental mechanisms in phase change and boiling, using detailed numerical simulations to connect physical phenomena with measurable outcomes.</p>

<h2>What I did</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Designed and implemented high-fidelity simulation workflows for phase-change problems.</li>
  <li>Analyzed the resulting data to understand key drivers and sensitivities.</li>
  <li>Translated findings into publishable insights and thesis work.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Outcomes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Foundational results for my graduate thesis work.</li>
  <li>Methods and datasets that informed later research.</li>
</ul>
