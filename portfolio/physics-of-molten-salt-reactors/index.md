title: "Physics and modelling of molten-salt reactors"
---

This page outlines my ongoing research into molten-salt reactor (MSR) physics and their computational models. This effort forms part of my work at the Danish developer of floating MSR power barges, <a href="https://www.saltfoss.com">Saltfoss Energy (formerly Seaborg Technologies)</a>.

<h2>Focus</h2>
<p>Build and validate models that capture physics & engineering aspects of MSRs, especially with regard to their dynamics behaviour.</p>

<h2>What I do</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Develop, verify and validate computational models for MSR systems.</li>
  <li>Generate novel insights about MSR dynamics.</li>
  <li>Develop and maintain MSR physics expertise.</li>
  <li>Collaborate with partners in Denmark and internationally.</li>
  <li>Publish scientific papers, present at conferences and workshops, supervise students.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Outcomes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Published three peer-reviewed journal papers as well as seven peer-reviewed conference papers.</li>
<li>Bolstered company's technical visibility.</li>
</ul>
