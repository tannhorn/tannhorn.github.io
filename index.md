about: |
  I build and validate computational models that help teams make confident engineering decisions. My background is in computational physics and engineering, and I've worked on problems ranging from microscopic physics phenomena to system-level analyses.

  In deep-tech R&D roles, I've taken ideas from early scoping through implementation and validation—both as an individual contributor and as a technical lead. I'm comfortable navigating the wider framing of a problem and choosing the simplest model that still captures the physics that matters.

  I hold a PhD from the Institute of Physics at EPF Lausanne (EPFL) and a Joint Master's Degree in Nuclear Engineering from ETH Zurich and EPFL. I care about clarity: translating complex results into useful, actionable insights.
